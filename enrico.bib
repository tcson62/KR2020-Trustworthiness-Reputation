	databases, such as assert and retract, inthe PROLOG language, the
	management of PROLOG databases isan important but difficult problem
	in a compiler-basedsystem. There are conceptually two PROLOG databases
	in sucha system: the Code DataBase (CDB), and the Source DataBase(SDB).
	In this paper, an approach to the implementation ofthe CDB and SDB
	in WAM-based systems is described, withemphasis being put on the
	implementation of the CDB. Themethod for the reclamation of retracted
	clauses used inour approach is the reference counting method. At
	the endof the paper, we briefly discuss how the predicates thatoperate
	on databases can be implemented easily with supportsfrom the CDB
	and the SDB. Though the approach is mainly foruse in GKD-PROLOG-2
	which is a compiler-based system, it canbe applied to other WAM-based
	systems with minor modification.},

	to reduce the number of clauses to betried and avoid the pushing

	in a commercialProlog system for dynamic code. In BIM_Prolog, dynamic
	codeis emulated WAM code, so we assume the reader is familiarwith
	the WAM. The description of indexing for dynamic codeis thus in terms
	of generated intermediate code and theimplementation of this code
	is in C. We point out thebenefits of this approach and give some

	Abstract = {If the Prolog built-in {\em assert} is implemented in itsmost general
	form it requires a full compiler and retention ofthe compile-time
	environment during execution. Many programsdo not need this much
	generality because they assert clauses- often ground unit clauses
	- for only one predicate whosefunctor, arity, arguments' types and
	possibly even thearguments' values are known at compile time. We
	categorizea family of these {\em simple clauses} in this paper.Programs
	that assert simple clauses compile a clause templatefor each predicate
	and generate a clause-specific routinecalled an {\em assertive demon}.
	At run time the demon copiesand fills in the template for each clause
	asserted. Assertivedemons either replace the full compiler at run
	time, orlimit its use to clauses too complex for the demon to handle.},
